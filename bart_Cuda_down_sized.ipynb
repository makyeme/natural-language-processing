       "['Mr. Phileas Fogg lived, in 1872, at No. 7, Saville Row, Burlington Gardens. He was one of the most noticeable members of the Reform Club. People said that he resembled Byron.',\n",
       " 'Phileas Fogg was a member of the Reform, and that was all. He was recommended by the Barings, with whom he had an open credit. His cheques were regularly paid at sight from his account current.',\n",
       " 'Phileas Fogg was the least communicative of men. He talked very little, and seemed all the more mysterious for his taciturn manner. His daily habits were quite open to observation. But whatever he did was so exactly the same thing that he had always done before.',\n",
       " 'Phileas Fogg was not known to have either wife or children. He lived alone in his house in Saville Row, whither none penetrated. He breakfasted and dined at the club, at hours mathematically fixed.',\n",
       " 'He passed ten hours out of the twenty-four in Saville Row, either in sleeping or making his toilet. When he chose to take a walk it was with a regular step in the entrance hall with its mosaic flooring, or in the circular gallery with its dome supported by twenty red porphyry Ionic columns.',\n",
       " 'Phileas Fogg was awaiting his successor, who was due at the house between eleven and half-past. He had dismissed James Forster because that luckless youth had brought him shaving-water at eighty-four degrees Fahrenheit instead of eighty-six. At exactly half- Past 11 Mr. Fogg would quit Saville Row, and repair to the Reform.',\n",
       " 'A young man of thirty advanced and bowed. \"You are a Frenchman, I believe,\" asked Phileas Fogg, \"and your name is John?\" \"Jean, if monsieur pleases,\" replied the newcomer, \"Jean Passepartout, a surname which has clung to me\"',\n",
       " '\"Passepartout suits me,\" responded Mr. Fogg. \"You are well recommended to me; I hear a good report of you. You know my conditions?\" \"Yes, monsieur.\" \"Good! What time is it?\" \"Twenty-two minutes after eleven,\" returned Passepartout, drawing an enormous silver watch from the depths of his pocket.',\n",
       " \"From the club it soon got into the papers throughout England. The Times, Standard, Morning Post, and Daily News scouted Mr. Fogg's project as madness. People in general thought him a lunatic, and blamed his Reform Club friends for having accepted a wager.\",\n",
       " 'At first some rash individuals espoused his cause, which became still more popular when the Illustrated London News came out with his portrait. A few readers of the Daily Telegraph even dared to say, \"Why not, after all? Stranger things have come to pass\"',\n",
       " 'There were accidents to machinery, the liability of trains to run off the line, collisions, bad weather, the blocking up by snow. Would he not find himself, when travelling by steamer in winter, at the mercy of the winds and fogs? Is it uncommon for the best ocean steamers to be two or three days behind time?',\n",
       " 'But five days after the article in the bulletin of the Geographical Society appeared, the demand began to subside. Lord Albemarle, an elderly paralytic gentleman, was now the only advocate of Phileas Fogg left. This noble lord would have given his fortune to be able to make the tour of the world, if it took ten years.',\n",
       " 'The bank robber, Phileas Fogg, was found at the Reform Club in London. He had been on a tour round the world on the pretext of a wager.',\n",
       " '\"I\\'ll go and fetch my master, who won\\'t be much pleased, however, to be disturbed.\" The passenger bowed to Fix, and returned to the steamer. \"Ah! Mr. Fogg is a character, is he?\" \"I should say he was.\"',\n",
       " 'He continued to pump poor Passepartout, and learned that he really knew little or nothing of his master. Fix felt sure that Phileas Fogg would not land at Suez, but was really going on to Bombay. \"The deuce! I was going to tell you there\\'s one thing that worries me—my burner!\"',\n",
       " '\"Consul,\" said he, \"I have no longer any doubt. I have spotted my man\" \"Then he\\'s a sharp fellow,\" returned the consul, \"and counts on returning to London after putting the police of the two countries off his track\" \"We\\'ll see about that,\" replied Fix. \"But are you not mistaken?\" \"I am not mistaken.\"',\n",
       " '\"Monsieur Fix,\" resumed Passepartout, \"I\\'m charmed to find you on board. Where are you bound?\" \"Like you, to Bombay.\" \"That\\'s capital! Have you made this trip before?\" \"Several times. I am one of the agents of the Peninsular Company\"',\n",
       " 'No; all these gymnastics, you may be sure, will cease at Bombay.\" \"And Mr. Fogg is getting on well?\" asked Fix, in the most natural tone in the world. \"Quite well, and I too. I eat like a famished ogre; it\\'s the sea air.\" \"But I never see your master on deck.\" \"Never; he hasn\\'t the least curiosity.\"',\n",
       " 'Passepartout was ravished to behold this celebrated place, and thought that, with its circular walls and dismantled fort, it looked like an immense coffee-cup and saucer.',\n",
       " 'The visa procured, Mr. Fogg returned on board to resume his former habits. Passepartout, according to custom, sauntered about among the mixed population of Aden. He gazed with wonder upon the fortifications which make this place the Gibraltar of the Indian Ocean.',\n",
       " 'The trip was being accomplished most successfully, and Passepartout was enchanted with the congenial companion which chance had secured him in the person of the delightful Fix. Phileas Fogg was in the act of finishing the thirty-third rubber of the voyage, and his partner and himself having, by a bold stroke, captured all thirteen of the tricks, concluded this fine campaign with a brilliant victory.',\n",
       " 'The British Crown exercises a real and despotic dominion over the larger portion of this vast country. A considerable portion of India is still free from British authority; and there are certain ferocious rajahs in the interior who are absolutely independent.',\n",
       " 'Formerly one was obliged to travel in India by the old cumbrous methods of going on foot or on horseback, in palanquins or unwieldy coaches. Now fast steamboats ply on the Indus and the Ganges, and a great railway traverses the peninsula from Bombay to Calcutta in three days.',\n",
       " 'The passengers of the Mongolia went ashore at half-past four p.m.; at exactly eight the train would start for Calcutta. Mr. Fogg would not deign to examine even the masterpieces of Elephanta, or the mysterious hypogea, concealed south-east from the docks.',\n",
       " 'Among the dishes served up to him, the landlord especially recommended a certain giblet of \"native rabbit\" Mr. Fogg accordingly tasted the dish, but, despite its spiced sauce, found it far from palatable. He rang for the landlord, and, on his appearance, said, \"Is this rabbit, sir?\"',\n",
       " 'It had not reached the office; indeed, there had not yet been time for it to arrive. Fix was sorely disappointed, and tried to obtain an order of arrest from the director of the Bombay police. This the director refused, as the matter concerned the London office, which alone could legally deliver the warrant.',\n",
       " 'Having purchased the usual quota of shirts and shoes, he took a leisurely promenade about the streets. It happened to be the day of a Parsee festival. These descendants of the sect of Zoroaster were celebrating a sort of religious carnival.',\n",
       " 'Passepartout was ignorant that it is forbidden to Christians to enter certain Indian temples. He went in like a simple tourist, and was soon lost in admiration of the splendid Brahmin ornamentation.',\n",
       " 'At five minutes before eight, Passepartout, hatless, shoeless, and having in the squabble lost his package of shirts and shoes, rushed breathlessly into the station. Fix, who had followed Mr. Fogg to the station, and saw that he was really going to leave Bombay, was there, upon the platform. He had resolved to follow the supposed robber to Calcutta, and farther, if necessary.',\n",
       " \"Among the passengers were a number of officers, Government officials, and opium and indigo merchants. Passepartout rode in the same carriage with his master, and a third passenger occupied a seat opposite to them. This was Sir Francis Cromarty, one of Mr. Fogg's whist partners on the Mongolia, now on his way to join his corps at Benares.\",\n",
       " 'Sir Francis Cromarty had observed the oddity of his travelling companion. The brigadier-general was free to mentally confess that, of all the eccentric persons he had ever met, none was comparable to Phileas Fogg.',\n",
       " 'Phileas Fogg and Sir Francis Cromarty exchanged a few words from time to time. \"Such a delay would not have deranged my plans in the least,\" said Mr. Fogg. \"The Government is very severe upon that kind of offence\"',\n",
       " 'I don\\'t see how this affair could have delayed his master.\" The conversation fell again. During the night the train left the mountains behind, and passed Nassik. The next day proceeded over the flat, well-cultivated country of the Khandeish. This fertile territory is watered by numerous small rivers and limpid streams.',\n",
       " 'The Thuggee chief, king of the stranglers, held his sway. These ruffians, united by a secret bond, strangled victims of every age in honour of the goddess Death.',\n",
       " 'The travellers made a hasty breakfast and started off for Assurghur, after skirting for a little the banks of the small river Tapty, which empties into the Gulf of Cambray, near Surat. Passepartout was now plunged into absorbing reverie.',\n",
       " 'Being much less cool-headed than Mr. Fogg, he was much more restless, counting and recounting the days passed over, uttering maledictions when the train stopped, and accusing it of sluggishness. The worthy fellow was ignorant that, while it was possible by such means to hasten the rate of a steamer, it could not be done on the railway.',\n",
       " 'The train stopped, at eight o\\'clock, in the midst of a glade some fifteen miles beyond Rothal, where there were several bungalows, and workmen\\'s cabins. Passepartout, not less surprised, rushed out and speedily returned, crying: \"Monsieur, no more railway!\"',\n",
       " '\"What would you have, officer? The papers were mistaken.\" \"Yet you sell tickets from Bombay to Calcutta,\" retorted Sir Francis. \"No doubt,\" replied the conductor, \"but the passengers know that they must provide means of transportation for themselves\"',\n",
       " 'The papers were like some watches, which have a way of getting too fast, and had been premature in their announcement of the completion of the line. The greater part of the travellers were aware of this interruption, and, leaving the train, began to engage such vehicles as the village could provide.',\n",
       " 'An Indian came out of the hut, and, at their request, conducted them within the enclosure. The elephant, which its owner had reared, not for a beast of burden, but for warlike purposes. Kiouni—this was the name of the beast—could doubtless travel rapidly for a long time.',\n",
       " 'Mr. Fogg persisted, offering the excessive sum of ten pounds an hour for the loan of the beast to Allahabad. The Indian, perhaps thinking he was going to make a great bargain, still refused. Phileas Fogg then proposed to purchase the animal outright, and at first offered a thousand pounds.',\n",
       " 'Mr. Fogg offered first twelve hundred, then fifteen hundred, eighteen hundred, two thousand pounds. \"What a price, good heavens!\" cried Passepartout, \"for an elephant\" The elephant was led out and equipped.',\n",
       " \"Provisions were purchased at Kholby, and, while Sir Francis and Mr. Fogg took the howdahs on either side, Passepartout got astride the saddle-cloth between them. The Parsee perched himself on the elephant's neck, and at nine o'clock they set out from the village.\",\n",
       " \"As for Passepartout, who was mounted on the beast's back, and received the direct force of each concussion as he trod along, he was very careful, in accordance with his master's advice, to keep his tongue from between his teeth. After two hours the guide stopped the elephant, and gave him an hour for rest, during which Kiouni, after quenching his thirst at a neighbouring spring, set to devouring the branches and shrubs round about\",\n",
       " 'At noon the Parsee gave the signal of departure. The country soon presented a very savage aspect. Copses of dates and dwarf-palms succeeded the dense forests.',\n",
       " 'Mr. Fogg wondered what he would do with the elephant when he got to Allahabad. The cost of transporting him would make him ruinously expensive. Would he sell him, or set him free?',\n",
       " 'Nothing occurred during the night to disturb the slumberers, although occasional growls from panthers and chatterings of monkeys broke the silence. The journey was resumed at six in the morning; the guide hoped to reach Allahabad by evening.',\n",
       " 'Allahabad was now only twelve miles to the north-east. They stopped under a clump of bananas, the fruit of which, as healthy as bread and as succulent as cream, was amply partaken of and appreciated. The elephant, becoming restless, suddenly stopped.',\n",
       " 'The guide unloosed the elephant and led him into a thicket, at the same time asking the travellers not to stir. He evidently thought that the procession of the faithful would pass without perceiving them amid the thick foliage.',\n",
       " 'Upon the car, which was drawn by four richly caparisoned zebus, stood a hideous statue with four arms, the body coloured a dull red. Sir Francis, recognising the statue, whispered, \"The goddess Kali; the goddess of love and death.\"',\n",
       " 'The guards who followed the young woman presented a violent contrast to her, armed as they were with naked sabres hung at their waists. Next came the musicians and a rearguard of capering fakirs, whose cries sometimes drowned the noise of the instruments. The procession slowly wound under the trees, and soon its last ranks disappeared in the depths of the wood.',\n",
       " '\"A suttee,\" returned the general, \"is a human sacrifice, but a voluntary one\" \"Oh, the scoundrels!\" cried Passepartout, who could not repress his indignation. \"And the corpse?\" asked Mr. Fogg. \"Is that of the prince, her husband\"',\n",
       " 'They would shave off her hair, feed her on a scanty allowance of rice, treat her with contempt. She would be looked upon as an unclean creature, and would die in some corner, like a scurvy dog. The prospect of so frightful an existence drives these poor creatures to the sacrifice.',\n",
       " '\"That was because they had intoxicated her with fumes of hemp and opium.\" \"But where are they taking her?\" \"To the pagoda of Pillaji, two miles from here; she will pass the night there.\" \"And the sacrifice will take place—\" \"To-morrow, at the first light of dawn.\"',\n",
       " 'Mr. Fogg and Sir Francis espied the victim. She seemed, having shaken off the stupor of intoxication, to be striving to escape from her executioner.',\n",
       " 'At this moment Sir Francis and the guide seized Phileas Fogg, who, in an instant of mad generosity, was about to rush upon the pyre. But he had quickly pushed them aside, when the whole scene suddenly changed. The old rajah was not dead, then, since he rose of a sudden, like a spectre, took up his wife in his arms.',\n",
       " \"It was Passepartout himself, who had slipped upon the pyre in the midst of the smoke and, profiting by the still overhanging darkness, had delivered the young woman from death. A moment after all four of the party had disappeared in the woods, and the elephant was bearing them away at a rapid pace. But the cries and noise, and a ball which whizzed through Phileas Fogg's hat, apprised them that the trick had\",\n",
       " 'Sir Francis pressed the worthy fellow\\'s hand, and his master said, \"Well done!\" which, from him, was high commendation. Passepartout replied that all the credit of the affair belonged to Mr. Fogg. As for him, he had only been struck with a \"queer\" idea.',\n",
       " 'Phileas Fogg and Aouda Passepartout left Allahabad for Calcutta on October 24th. They would be able to take a steamer to Hong Kong on October 25th. The young woman was placed in one of the waiting-rooms of the station. She was charged with buying toilet, a dress, shawl, and some furs.',\n",
       " \"The Ganges, according to the legends of the Ramayana, rises in heaven, whence, owing to Brahma's agency, it descends to the earth. The influence to which the priests of Pillaji had subjected Aouda began gradually to yield.\",\n",
       " \"Her ebony brows have the form and charm of the bow of Kama, the god of love, and beneath her long silken lashes the purest reflections. Her teeth, fine, equal, and white, glitter between her smiling lips like dewdrops in a passion-flower's half-enveloped breast. Her delicately formed ears, her vermilion hands, her little feet, glitter with the brilliancy of the loveliest pearls of\",\n",
       " 'Mr. Fogg proceeded to pay the guide the price agreed upon for his service, and not a farthing more. What should be done with the elephant, which had been so dearly purchased? Phileas Fogg had already determined this.',\n",
       " '\"Good!\" exclaimed Passepartout. \"Take him, friend. Kiouni is a brave and faithful beast.\" And, going up to the elephant, he gave him several lumps of sugar. The elephant grunted out his satisfaction, and lifted him as high as his head.',\n",
       " 'Mr. Fogg said nothing; while Passepartout, abashed, kept repeating that \"it wasn\\'t worth telling\" Aouda pathetically thanked her deliverers, rather with tears than words.',\n",
       " \"Benares was Sir Francis Cromarty's destination, the troops he was rejoining being encamped some miles northward of the city. The railway, on leaving Benares, passed for a while along the valley of the Ganges. Through the windows of their carriage the travellers had glimpses of the diversified landscape of Behar.\",\n",
       " 'These were fervent Brahmins, the bitterest foes of Buddhism. Their deities were Vishnu, the solar god, Shiva, the divine impersonation of natural forces, and Brahma, the supreme ruler of priests and legislators.',\n",
       " 'Night came on; the train passed on at full speed, in the midst of the roaring of the tigers, bears, and wolves which fled before the locomotive. Calcutta was reached at seven in the morning, and the packet left for Hong Kong at noon; so that Phileas Fogg had five hours before him.',\n",
       " 'Phileas Fogg intended to proceed at once to the Hong Kong steamer, in order to get Aouda comfortably settled for the voyage. He was unwilling to leave her while they were still on dangerous ground.',\n",
       " 'The carriage stopped before a modest-looking house, which, however, did not have the appearance of a private mansion. Aouda, with an emotion she tried to conceal, said to Mr. Fogg: \"Sir, you must leave me to my fate!\"',\n",
       " 'At half-past eight the door opened, the policeman appeared, and, requesting them to follow him, led the way to an adjoining hall. It was evidently a court-room, and a crowd of Europeans and natives already occupied the rear of the apartment. The wigs were exchanged.',\n",
       " '\"The first case,\" repeated Judge Obadiah. \"Phileas Fogg?\" demanded Oysterpuff. \"I am here,\" replied Mr. Fogg. \"Passepartout?\" \"Present,\" responded Passepartout. \"Good,\" said the judge. \"You have been looked for, prisoners, for two days on the trains from Bombay.\"',\n",
       " '\"I wish to hear these priests admit, in their turn, what they were going to do at the pagoda of Pillaji.\" The priests looked at each other; they did not seem to understand what was said. \"Bombay?\" cried Passepartout. \"Certainly. We are not talking of the pagodas in Bombay, but of the Pagoda of Malabar Hill\"',\n",
       " 'Fix and the priests reached the Indian capital before Mr. Fogg and his servant. The magistrates had been warned by a dispatch to arrest them should they arrive.',\n",
       " 'Judge Obadiah had unfortunately caught Passepartout\\'s rash exclamation, which the poor fellow would have given the world to recall. \"The facts are admitted?\" asked the judge. \"Admitted,\" replied Mr. Fogg, coldly. \"Inasmuch,\" resumed the judge, \"as the English law protects equally and sternly the religions of the Indian people\"',\n",
       " 'Passepartout was stupefied. This sentence ruined his master. A wager of twenty thousand pounds lost, because he, like a precious fool, had gone into that abominable pagoda! Phileas Fogg did not even lift his eyebrows while it was being pronounced.',\n",
       " '\"More than a thousand pounds apiece; besides, they pinch my feet.\" Mr. Fogg, offering his arm to Aouda, then departed, followed by the crestfallen Passepartout. Fix still nourished hopes that the robber would not, after all, leave the two thousand pounds behind him, but would decide to serve out his week in jail.',\n",
       " 'The Rangoon was a screw steamer, built of iron, weighing about seventeen hundred and seventy tons. She was as fast, but not as well fitted up, as the Mongolia. Aouda was not as comfortably provided for on board of her as Phileas Fogg could have wished.',\n",
       " \"He visited her regularly each day at certain hours, not so much to talk himself, as to sit and hear her talk. After all, she owed Phileas Fogg her life, and she always regarded him through the exalting medium of her gratitude. Aouda confirmed the Parsee guide's narrative of her touching history.\",\n",
       " 'Aouda fastened her great eyes, \"clear as the sacred lakes of the Himalaya,\" upon him. The intractable Fogg, as reserved as ever, did not seem at all inclined to throw himself into this lake. The panorama of the islands, as they steamed by them, was superb.',\n",
       " \"The Rangoon rapidly approached the Straits of Malacca, which gave access to the China seas. All the detective's hopes and wishes were now centred on Hong Kong. The arrest must be made at Hong Kong, or the robber would probably escape him.\",\n",
       " 'If the warrant should at last make its appearance at Hong Kong, Fix could arrest him and give him into the hands of the local police, and there would be no further trouble. But beyond Hong Kong a simple warrant would be of no avail; an extradition Warrant would be necessary, and that would result in delays and obstacles. Fix thought over these probabilities during the long hours which he spent in his cabin.',\n",
       " \"The presence of Aouda on the Rangoon gave him new material for reflection. Who was this woman? What combination of events had made her Fogg's travelling companion? They had evidently met somewhere between Bombay and Calcutta. Had they met accidentally, or had Fogg gone into the interior purposely in quest of this charming damsel? Fix was fairly puzzled. He asked himself whether there had not been a wicked elopement.\",\n",
       " 'Fix decided that he must warn the English authorities, and signal the Rangoon before her arrival. He finally resolved, moreover, before acting more positively, to question Passepartout. It would not be difficult to make him talk.',\n",
       " '\"Why, I left you at Bombay, and here you are, on the way to Hong Kong! Are you going round the world too?\" \"No, no,\" replied Fix; \"I shall stop at Hong Kong—at least for some days.\" \"Hum!\" said Passepartout, who seemed for an instant perplexed. \"But how is it I have not seen you on board since we left Calcutta?\" \"Oh, a trifle of sea-s',\n",
       " '\"But does your master propose to carry this young woman to Europe?\" \"Not at all. We are simply going to place her under the protection of one of her relatives, a rich merchant at Hong Kong.\" \"Nothing to be done there,\" said Fix to himself, concealing his disappointment. \"Willingly, Monsieur Fix. We must at least have a friendly glass on board the Rangoon.\"',\n",
       " 'If he did not find it practicable to arrest Fogg at Hong Kong, and if Fogg made preparations to leave that last foothold of English territory, he, Fix, would tell Passepartout all. Either the servant was the accomplice of his master, and in this case the master knew of his operations, and he should fail. Or else the servant knew nothing about the robbery, and then his interest would be to abandon the robber. Such was the situation between Fix and',\n",
       " \"It was every day an increasing wonder to Passepartout, who read in Aouda's eyes the depths of her gratitude to his master. Phileas Fogg, though brave and gallant, must be, he thought, quite heartless. The weather was bad during the latter days of the voyage.\",\n",
       " 'A sort of tempest arose on the 3rd of November, the squall knocking the vessel about with fury. Phileas Fogg gazed at the tempestuous sea, which seemed to be struggling especially to delay him, with his habitual tranquillity. The storm greatly pleased him.',\n",
       " 'Each delay filled him with hope, for it became more and more probable that Fogg would be obliged to remain some days at Hong Kong. The heavens themselves became his allies, with the gusts and squalls. It mattered not that they made him sea-sick—he made no account of this inconvenience.',\n",
       " 'Passepartout remained on deck as long as the tempest lasted, being unable to remain quiet below. He overwhelmed the captain, officers, and sailors with all sorts of questions.',\n",
       " 'The pilot went on board at six, and took his place on the bridge, to guide the Rangoon through the channels to the port of Hong Kong. Passepartout longed to ask him if the steamer had left for Yokohama; but he dared not, for he wished to preserve the spark of hope.',\n",
       " '\"Thank you,\" returned Mr. Fogg, descending mathematically to the saloon. Passepartout clasped the pilot\\'s hand and shook it heartily in his delight. \"Pilot, you are the best of good fellows!\"',\n",
       " 'He found himself, then, about twenty-four hours behind-hand, thirty-five days after leaving London. The Carnatic was announced to leave Hong Kong at five the next morning. Mr. Fogg had sixteen hours in which to attend to his business there.',\n",
       " 'Phileas Fogg returned to the hotel, begged a moment\\'s conversation with Aouda, and without more ado, apprised her that Jeejeeh was no longer at Hong Kong, but probably in Holland. She passed her hand across her forehead, and reflected a few moments. Then, in her sweet, soft voice, she said: \"What ought I to do, Mr. Fogg?\"',\n",
       " 'The island is situated at the mouth of the Canton River, and is separated by about sixty miles from the Portuguese town of Macao, on the opposite coast. Hong Kong has beaten Macao in the struggle for the Chinese trade.',\n",
       " 'Passepartout noticed in the crowd a number of the natives who seemed very old and were dressed in yellow. On reaching the quay where they were to embark on the Carnatic, he was not astonished to find Fix walking up and down.',\n",
       " '\"Well, Monsieur Fix,\" said Passepartout, \"have you decided to go with us so far as America?\" \"Yes,\" returned Fix, through his set teeth. \"Good!\" exclaimed Passe Partout, laughing heartily. \"I knew you could not persuade yourself to separate from us. Come and engage your berth.\"',\n",
       " 'At the small tables which were arranged about the room some thirty customers were drinking English beer, porter, gin, and brandy; smoking, the while, long red clay pipes stuffed with little balls of opium mingled with essence of rose. One of the smokers, overcome with the narcotic, would slip under the table, whereupon the waiters, taking him by the head and feet, carried and laid him upon the bed.',\n",
       " 'Opium is smoked everywhere, at all times, by men and women, in the Celestial Empire. A great smoker can smoke as many as eight pipes a day; but he dies in five years.',\n",
       " 'cried Passepartout, drinking up the little wine that was left in the bottom of his glass. \"Well, we\\'ll talk about it to-morrow; I haven\\'t time now.\" \"Stay! What I have to say concerns your master.\" \"Of course I do,\" returned Passe Partout, \"Twenty thousand pounds.\" \"Fifty-five thousand!\" answered Fix, pressing his companion\\'s hand.',\n",
       " 'Fix pushed Passepartout back in his chair, and resumed: \"Fifty-five thousand pounds; and if I succeed, I get two thousand pounds. If you\\'ll help me, I\\'ll let you have five hundred of them.\" \"Help me keep Mr. Fogg here for two or three days.\" \"Why, what are you saying? Those gentlemen are not satisfied with following my master and suspecting his honour!\"',\n",
       " '\"But who do you think I am?\" asked Fix, looking at him intently. Passepartout\\'s mistake seemed sincere, but it made his design more difficult. It was evident that the servant was not the master\\'s accomplice, as Fix had been inclined to suspect. He had no time to lose: Fogg must be detained at Hong Kong, so he resolved to make a clean breast of it.',\n",
       " '\"You, a detective?\" \"I will prove it. Here is my commission.\" Passepartout was speechless with astonishment when Fix displayed this document. \"Mr. Fogg\\'s wager,\" resumed Fix, \"is only a pretext, of which you and the gentlemen of the Reform are dupes\"',\n",
       " '\"Would you like to be arrested as his accomplice?\" Passepartout held his head between his hands, and did not dare to look at the detective. \"I will share with you the two thousand pounds reward offered by the Bank of England.\"',\n",
       " 'I come from a village where they don\\'t eat that kind of bread!\" \"You refuse?\" \"I refuse.\" \"Consider that I\\'ve said nothing,\" said Fix; \"and let us drink\" Passepartout felt himself yielding more and more to the effects of the liquor. Fix slipped one of the opium pipes into his hand and drew several puffs.',\n",
       " \"It was all very well for an Englishman like Mr. Fogg to make the tour of the world with a carpet-bag; a lady could not be expected to travel comfortably under such conditions. The purchases made, they returned to the hotel, where they dined at a sumptuously served table-d'hote.\",\n",
       " \"It was then eight o'clock; at half-past nine, it being then high tide, the Carnatic would leave the harbour. Mr. Fogg and Aouda got into the palanquin, their luggage being brought after on a wheelbarrow. Half an hour later they stepped upon the quay whence they were to embark.\",\n",
       " 'Could he have gone on board the Carnatic without us?\" \"Without you, madam?\" answered the detective. The Carnatic, its repairs being completed, left Hong Kong twelve hours before the stated time, without any notice being given. \"We must now wait a week for another steamer\"',\n",
       " 'Phileas Fogg wandered about the docks, with the determination, if necessary, to charter a vessel to carry him to Yokohama. He could only find vessels which were loading or unloading, and which could not therefore set sail.',\n",
       " '\"I offer you a hundred pounds per day, and an additional reward of two hundred pounds if I reach Yokohama in time.\" \"Are you in earnest?\" \"Very much so,\" says the pilot. \"But,\" added the pilot, \"it might be arranged another way.\"',\n",
       " 'In going to Shanghai we should not be forced to sail wide of the Chinese coast, which would be a great advantage, as the currents run northward, and would aid us. We have, therefore, four days before us, that is ninety-six hours; and in that time, if we had good luck and a south-west wind, and the sea was calm, we could make those eight hundred miles to Shanghai.\"',\n",
       " '\"I shall do all I can to find him,\" replied Phileas Fogg. While Fix, in a feverish, nervous state, repaired to the pilot-boat. The Tankadere was a neat little craft of twenty tons.',\n",
       " 'The crew of the Tankadere was composed of John Bunsby, the master, and four hardy mariners, who were familiar with the Chinese seas. Phileas Fogg and Aouda went on board, where they found Fix already installed.',\n",
       " 'Fix was not without his fears lest chance should direct the steps of the unfortunate servant, whom he had so badly treated, in this direction. But the Frenchman did not appear, and, without doubt, was still lying under the stupefying influence of the opium. The Chinese seas are usually boisterous, subject to terrible gales of wind, and especially during the equinoxes; and it was now early November.',\n",
       " 'But John Bunsby believed in the Tankadere, which rode on the waves like a seagull. Late in the day they passed through the capricious channels of Hong Kong. \"I do not need, pilot,\" said Phileas Fogg, when they got into the open sea.',\n",
       " 'Night came. The moon was entering her first quarter, and her insufficient light would soon die out in the mist on the horizon. Clouds were rising from the east, and already overcast a part of the heavens. The pilot had hung out his lights, which was very necessary in these seas crowded with vessels bound landward.',\n",
       " 'Phileas Fogg was also thinking of Passepartout, who had so strangely disappeared. It did not seem to him impossible that, by some mistake, the man might have embarked on the Carnatic at the last moment. They might then find him at Yokohama.',\n",
       " 'The Tankadere bore sail admirably, as she drew a great deal of water, and everything was prepared for high speed in case of a gale. At sunrise the next day, which was 8th November, the boat had made more than one hundred miles. The log indicated a mean speed of between eight and nine miles.',\n",
       " 'The pilot put up his poles, but took them down again within two hours. Mr. Fogg and Aouda, happily unaffected by the roughness of the sea, ate with a good appetite. Fix was invited to share their repast, which he accepted with secret chagrin.',\n",
       " 'The Tankadere entered the Straits of Fo-Kien, which separate the island of Formosa from the Chinese coast, in the small hours of the night, and crossed the Tropic of Cancer. By evening, the log showed that two hundred and twenty miles had been accomplished from Hong Kong.',\n",
       " 'At daybreak the wind began to blow hard again, and the heavens seemed to predict a gale. John Bunsby long examined the threatening aspect of the heavens, muttering indistinctly between his teeth. He said in a low voice to Mr. Fogg, \"Shall I speak out to your honour?\"',\n",
       " 'The pilot reefed all sail, the pole-masts were dispensed with; all hands went forward to the bows. A single triangular sail, of strong canvas, was hoisted as a storm-jib. The Tankadere was lifted like a feather by a wind, an idea of whose violence can scarcely be given.',\n",
       " 'The passengers were often bathed in spray, but they submitted to it philosophically. Fix cursed it, no doubt; but Aouda, with her eyes fastened upon her protector, whose coolness amazed her, showed herself worthy of him, and bravely weathered the storm.',\n",
       " '\"And that is—\" \"Shanghai.\" The pilot, at first, did not seem to comprehend. Then he cried, \"Well—yes! Your honour is right. To Shanghai!\" So the Tankadere kept steadily on her northward track.',\n",
       " 'The tempest had been as brief as terrific. The passengers, thoroughly exhausted, could now eat a little, and take some repose. The night was comparatively quiet. The next morning at dawn they espied the coast, and John Bunsby was able to assert that they were not one hundred miles from Shanghai. A hundred miles, and only one day to traverse them!',\n",
       " \"The Tankadere was so light, and her fine sails caught the fickle zephyrs so well, that, with the aid of the currents John Bunsby found himself at six o'clock not more than ten miles from the mouth of Shanghai River. Shanghai itself is situated at least twelve miles up the stream. At seven they were still three miles from Shanghai.\",\n",
       " 'It was loaded to the muzzle; but just as the pilot was about to apply a red-hot coal to the touchhole, Mr. Fogg said, \"Hoist your flag!\" The flag was run up at half-mast, and it was hoped that the American steamer, perceiving it, would change her course a little.',\n",
       " 'Three hours later, pursued even in his dreams by a fixed idea, the poor fellow awoke, and struggled against the stupefying influence of the narcotic. The next morning he found himself the next morning on the deck of the Carnatic, and eagerly inhaling the exhilarating sea-breeze.',\n",
       " 'He began to collect his sense, which he found a difficult task. Then he recalled the events of the evening before, Fix\\'s revelation, and the opium-house. \"It is evident,\" said he to himself, \"that I have been abominably drunk!\"',\n",
       " 'Passepartout got up and proceeded, as well as he could with the rolling of the steamer, to the after-deck. He saw no one who resembled either his master or Aouda. \"Good!\" muttered he; \"Mr. Fogg has probably found some partners at whist\"',\n",
       " 'He fell thunderstruck on a seat. He saw it all now. He remembered that the time of sailing had been changed, that he should have informed his master of that fact, and that he had not done so. It was his fault, then, that Mr. Fogg and Aouda had missed the steamer. Yes, but it was still more the fault of the traitor who, in order to separate him from his master, and detain the latter at Hong Kong',\n",
       " 'He fell to at meals with an appetite, and ate for Mr. Fogg, Aouda, and himself. He helped himself as generously as if Japan were a desert. He had nothing better to do than, taking chance for his guide, to wander aimlessly through the streets of Yokohama.',\n",
       " 'This quarter occupied, with its streets, squares, docks, and warehouses, all the space between the \"promontory of the Treaty\" and the river. Here, as at Hong Kong and Calcutta, were mixed crowds of all races, Americans and English. The Frenchman felt himself as much alone among them as if he had dropped down in the midst of Hottentots.',\n",
       " 'The streets were crowded with people. Priests were passing in processions, beating their dreary tambourines. The military profession is as much respected in Japan as it is despised in China.',\n",
       " 'Passepartout wandered for several hours in the midst of this motley crowd, looking in at the windows of the rich and curious shops. There he saw dazzling camellias expanding themselves, with flowers which were giving forth their last colours and perfumes.',\n",
       " 'Passepartout had taken good care to eat as hearty a breakfast as possible before leaving the Carnatic. He observed that the butchers stalls contained neither mutton, goat, nor pork. He made up his mind that meat was far from plentiful in Yokohama.',\n",
       " 'Passepartout thought he would sell his watch, but he would have starved first. The streets at last became quiet, and the patrol, in their splendid costumes, and surrounded by their suites, seemed like ambassadors.',\n",
       " 'Passepartout decided to wait several hours for the Mikado to arrive. He then decided to change his clothes for clothes more in harmony with his project. He found a native dealer in old clothes, to whom he applied for an exchange.',\n",
       " '\"I mustn\\'t lose my head. I can\\'t sell this costume again for one still more Japanese\" The difficulty was, how to traverse the four thousand seven hundred miles of the Pacific which lay between Japan and the New World.',\n",
       " \"Passepartout followed the clown, and soon found himself once more in the Japanese quarter. A quarter of an hour later he stopped before a large cabin, adorned with several clusters of streamers. The exterior walls of the cabin were designed to represent, in violent colours and without perspective, a company of jugglers. This was the Honourable William Batulcar's establishment.\",\n",
       " '\"Would you like a servant, sir?\" asked Passepartout. \"A servant!\" cried Mr. Batulcar. \"I already have two who are obedient and faithful, have never left me, and serve me for their nourishment\"',\n",
       " 'Passepartout was engaged to act in the celebrated Japanese troupe. He was not a very dignified position, but within a week he would be on his way to San Francisco.',\n",
       " \"Before three o'clock the large shed was invaded by the spectators, comprising Europeans and natives, Chinese and Japanese, men, women and children. The musicians took up a position inside, and were vigorously performing on their gongs, tam-tams, flutes, bones, tambourines, and immense drums. The performance was much like all acrobatic displays; but it must be confessed that the Japanese are the first equilibrists in the world.\",\n",
       " 'The Long Noses form a peculiar company, under the direct patronage of the god Tingou. Attired after the fashion of the Middle Ages, they bore upon their shoulders a splendid pair of wings. What especially distinguished them was the long noses which were fastened to their faces.',\n",
       " 'A dozen of these sectaries of Tingou lay flat upon their backs, while others, dressed to represent lightning-rods, came and frolicked on their noses. As a last scene, a \"human pyramid\" had been announced, in which fifty Long Noses were to represent the Car of Juggernaut. Instead of forming a pyramid by mounting each other\\'s shoulders, the artists were to group themselves on top of the noses.',\n",
       " 'They all stretched themselves on the floor, their noses pointing to the ceiling. A second group of artists disposed themselves on these long appendages. This elicited loud applause, in the midst of which the orchestra was just striking up a deafening air.',\n",
       " 'He demanded damages for the \"breakage\" of the pyramid. Phileas Fogg appeased him by giving him a handful of banknotes. They reached their destination on the morning of the 14th of November.',\n",
       " \"The San Francisco steamer was announced to leave that very evening, and it became necessary to find Passepartout, if possible, without delay. Mr. Fogg applied in vain to the French and English consuls, and, after wandering through the streets, began to despair of finding his missing servant. Chance, or perhaps a kind of presentiment, at last led him into the Honourable Mr. Batulcar's theatre.\",\n",
       " 'Mr. Fogg heard this narrative coldly, without a word; and then furnished his man with funds necessary to obtain clothing more in harmony with his position. Within an hour the Frenchman had cut off his nose and parted with his wings, and retained nothing about him which recalled the sectary of the god Tingou.',\n",
       " 'There was a full complement of passengers on board, among them English, many Americans, a large number of coolies on their way to California, and several East Indian officers. Nothing of moment happened on the voyage; the steamer, sustained on its large paddles, rolled but little.',\n",
       " \"Fogg took pains to calm Aouda's doubts of a successful termination of the journey. A railway train from San Francisco to New York, and a transatlantic steamer from New York to Liverpool would doubtless bring them to the end of this impossible journey.\",\n",
       " \"Passepartout made a joyful discovery on the 23rd of November. He found that his watch exactly agreed with the ship's chronometers. He would have liked to know what Fix would say if he were aboard!\",\n",
       " 'Passepartout was ignorant that, if the face of his watch had been divided into twenty-four hours, like the Italian clocks, he would have no reason for exultation. If Fix had been able to explain this purely physical effect, Passepart out would not have admitted, even if he had comprehended it.',\n",
       " 'It had followed him from Bombay, and had come by the Carnatic, on which steamer he himself was supposed to be. Mr. Fogg had left English ground, and it was now necessary to procure his extradition.',\n",
       " 'On that very day, however, he met Passepartout face to face on the forward deck. The latter, without a word, made a rush for him, grasped him by the throat, and administered to the detective a perfect volley of blows, which proved the great superiority of French over English pugilistic skill.',\n",
       " \"Sh! don't budge, and let me speak. As long as Mr. Fogg was on English ground, it was for my interest to detain him there until my warrant of arrest arrived. I did everything I could to keep him back. I sent the Bombay priests after him, I got you intoxicated at Hong Kong, I separated you from him, and I made him miss the Yokohama steamer. Your interest is the same as mine; for it is only in\",\n",
       " '\"Agreed,\" said the detective quietly. Eleven days later, the General Grant entered the bay of the Golden Gate, and reached San Francisco. Mr. Fogg had neither gained nor lost a single day.',\n",
       " \"Mr. Fogg, on reaching shore, proceeded to find out at what hour the first train left for New York, and learned that this was at six o'clock p.m. He had, therefore, an entire day to spend in the Californian capital.\",\n",
       " 'The lofty tower of its City Hall overlooked the whole panorama of the streets and avenues, which cut each other at right-angles. Sombreros and red shirts and plumed Indians were rarely to be seen; but there were silk hats and black coats everywhere worn by a multitude of gentlemanly-looking men.',\n",
       " 'Payment was made only for the ale, porter, or sherry which was drunk. This seemed \"very American\" to Passepartout. Mr. Fogg and Aouda were abundantly served on diminutive plates by negroes.',\n",
       " 'Mr. Fogg replied that the honour would be his; and the detective—who was determined not to lose sight of him—begged permission to accompany them in their walk about San Francisco. They soon found themselves in Montgomery Street, where a great crowd was collected. Men were going about carrying large posters, and flags and streamers were floating in the wind.',\n",
       " 'A large platform had been erected in the open air, towards which the current of the crowd seemed to be directed. The undulations of the human surge reached the steps, while all the heads floundered on the surface like a sea agitated by a squall.',\n",
       " '\"It is evidently a meeting,\" said Fix, \"and its object must be an exciting one. I should not wonder if it were about the Alabama, despite the fact that that question is settled.\" \"Perhaps,\" replied Mr. Fogg, simply. \"At least, there are two champions in presence of each other, the Honourable Mr. Camerfield and the Honourably Mr. Mandiboy.\"',\n",
       " '\"It would be prudent for us to retire,\" said Fix, who was anxious that Mr. Fogg should not receive any injury. \"If there is any question about England in all this, and we were recognised, I fear it would go hard with us,\" said Fogg.',\n",
       " 'An enormous bruise immediately made its appearance under the detective\\'s silk hat, which was completely smashed in. \"Yankee!\" exclaimed Mr. Fogg, darting a contemptuous look at the ruffian. \"We will meet again!\" returned the other.',\n",
       " 'An hour after, they were once more suitably attired, and with Aouda returned to the International Hotel. Passepartout was waiting for his master, armed with half a dozen six-barrelled revolvers. When he perceived Fix, he knit his brows; but his countenance resumed its placid expression.',\n",
       " 'The Pacific Railroad is divided into two distinct lines. The Central Pacific runs between San Francisco and Ogden, and the Union Pacific, between Ogden and Omaha. Five main lines connect Omaha with New York.',\n",
       " 'Between Omaha and the Pacific the railway crosses a territory which is still infested by Indians and wild beasts. The journey from New York to San Francisco consumed, formerly, under the most favourable conditions, at least six months. It is now accomplished in seven days.',\n",
       " 'On leaving Omaha, it passes along the left bank of the Platte River as far as the junction of its northern branch. Such was the road to be traversed in seven days, which would enable Phileas Fogg—at least, so he hoped—to take the Atlantic steamer at New York on the 11th for Liverpool. The car which he occupied was a sort of long omnibus on eight wheels, and with no compartments in the interior.',\n",
       " 'It was supplied with saloon cars, balcony cars, restaurants, and smoking-cars; theatre cars alone were wanting, and they will have these some day. Book and news dealers, sellers of edibles, drinkables, and cigars, were continually circulating in the aisles. Passepartout found himself beside the detective; but he did not talk to him.',\n",
       " 'Snow began to fall an hour after they started, a fine snow, however, which happily could not obstruct the train. The country between San Francisco and Sacramento is not very hilly. The Central Pacific, taking Sacramento for its starting-point, extends eastward to meet the road from Omaha.',\n",
       " 'The train, on leaving Sacramento, and passing the junction, Roclin, Auburn, and Colfax, entered the range of the Sierra Nevada. The railway track wound in and out among the passes, now approaching the mountain-sides, now suspended over precipices.',\n",
       " \"There were few or no bridges or tunnels on the route. The railway turned around the sides of the mountains. The train entered the State of Nevada through the Carson Valley about nine o'clock.\",\n",
       " \"About twelve o'clock a troop of ten or twelve thousand head of buffalo encumbered the track. The locomotive, slackening its speed, tried to clear the way with its cow-catcher. The buffaloes marched along with a tranquil gait.\",\n",
       " 'Parbleu! I should like to know if Mr. Fogg foresaw this mishap in his programme! And here\\'s an engineer who doesn\\'t dare to run the locomotive into this herd of beasts!\" The procession of buffaloes lasted three full hours, and it was night before the track was clear.',\n",
       " \"Passepartout, about nine o'clock, went out upon the platform to take the air. The weather was cold, the heavens grey, but it was not snowing. The sun's disc, enlarged by the mist, seemed an enormous ring of gold.\",\n",
       " '\"I\\'ll go,\" said Passepartout to himself. He knew nothing of Mormonism except the custom of polygamy. The news quickly spread through the train, which contained about one hundred passengers.',\n",
       " 'Elder Hitch was trying to make proselytes on the very railway trains. Then, emphasising his words with his loud voice and frequent gestures, he related the history of the Mormons from Biblical times. In Israel, a Mormon prophet of the tribe of Joseph published the annals of the new religion.',\n",
       " \"The Elder's story became somewhat wearisome, and his audience grew gradually less, until it was reduced to twenty passengers. But this did not disconcert the enthusiast, who proceeded with the story of Joseph Smith's bankruptcy in 1837.\",\n",
       " 'Passepartout was now the only person left in the car, and the Elder, looking him full in the face, reminded him that, two years after the assassination of Joseph Smith, the inspired prophet, Brigham Young, his successor, left Nauvoo for the banks of the Great Salt Lake. \"And this is why the jealousy of Congress has been aroused against us! Why have the soldiers of the Union invaded the soil of Utah?\"',\n",
       " '\"No!\" replied Passepartout courageously, in his turn retiring from the car, and leaving the Elder to preach to vacancy.

Very well; I will show these people that a Frenchman can be as American as they!\" \"All aboard!\" cried the conductor.',\n",
       " 'The locomotive whistled vigorously; the engineer, reversing the steam, backed the train for nearly a mile. The train leaped, so to speak, from one bank to the other, and the engineer could not stop it until it had gone five miles beyond the station.']"

But five days after the article in the Geographical Society appeared, the demand began to subside.

This the director refused, as the matter concerned the London office, which alone could legally deliver the warrant. Passepartout was ignorant that it is forbidden to Christians to enter certain Indian temples.',\n",

       " 'The pilot had hung out his lights, which was very necessary in these seas crowded with vessels bound landward. Phileas Fogg was also thinking of Passepartout, who had so strangely disappeared. It did not seem to him impossible that, by some mistake, the man might have embarked on the Carnatic.',\n",
       " 'By evening, the log showed that two hundred and twenty miles had been accomplished from Hong Kong. At daybreak the wind began to blow hard again, and the heavens seemed to predict a gale. John Bunsby long examined the threatening aspect of the heavens, muttering indistinctly between his teeth. He said in a low voice to Mr. Fogg, \"Shall I speak out to your honour?\"',\n",
       " 'The tempest had been as brief as terrific. The passengers, thoroughly exhausted, could now eat a little, and take some repose. The next morning at dawn they espied the coast, and John Bunsby was able to assert that they were not one hundred miles from Shanghai.',\n",
       " \"The next morning he found himself the next morning on the deck of the Carnatic, and eagerly inhaling the exhilarating sea-breeze. Then he recalled the events of the evening before, Fix's revelation, and the opium-house. He remembered that the time of sailing had been changed, that he should have informed his master of that fact, and that he had not done so.\",\n",
       " 'Passepartout wandered aimlessly through the streets of Yokohama. He saw dazzling camellias expanding themselves. Priests were passing in processions, beating their dreary tambourines.',\n",
       " 'He observed that the butchers stalls contained neither mutton, goat, nor pork. He made up his mind that meat was far from plentiful in Yokohama. Passepartout thought he would sell his watch, but he would have starved first.',\n",

As a last scene, a \"human pyramid\" had been announced, in which fifty Long Noses were to represent the Car of Juggernaut. They all stretched themselves on the floor, their noses pointing to the ceiling.',\n",
       " 'Mr. Fogg heard this narrative coldly, without a word; and then furnished his man with funds necessary to obtain clothing more in harmony with his position. Nothing of moment happened on the voyage; the steamer, sustained on its large paddles, rolled but little.',\n",
       " 'He would have liked to know what Fix would say if he were aboard! Passepartout was ignorant that, if the face of his watch had been divided into twenty-four hours, like the Italian clocks, he would have no reason for exultation. Mr. Fogg had left English ground, and it was now necessary to procure his extradition.',\n",
       " 'I sent the Bombay priests after him, I got you intoxicated at Hong Kong, I separated you from him, and I made him miss the Yokohama steamer. Your interest is the same as mine; for it is only in \"Agreed,\" said the detective quietly.',\n",
       " 'Mr. Fogg replied that the honour would be his; and the detective was determined not to lose sight of him. They soon found themselves in Montgomery Street, where a great crowd was collected. A large platform had been erected in the open air, towards which the current of the crowd seemed to be directed.',\n",
       " '\"If there is any question about England in all this, and we were recognised, I fear it would go hard with us,\" said Fogg. Passepartout was waiting for his master, armed with half a dozen six-barrelled revolvers.',\n",
